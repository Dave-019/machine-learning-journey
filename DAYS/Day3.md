# Day 3: Functions and File Handling  

Day 3 was all about leveling up with Python. I tackled functions and file handling—two things that separate "just a script" from "wow, this code is useful." Here's the breakdown:

## What I Learned  

1. **Functions**:  
   - Finally stopped copy-pasting code and started writing reusable blocks.  
   - Figured out how to pass arguments, return values, and even managed to debug some wonky logic (after way too long).  
   - Built-in functions? Cool. User-defined ones? Chef’s kiss.  

2. **File Handling**:  
   - Opened, read, wrote, and even appended to files. No files were harmed in the process (mostly).  
   - Learned the difference between `r`, `w`, `a`, and other modes. Spoiler: writing overwrites everything, and I definitely found out the hard way.  
   - Caught a few exceptions—turns out, files don’t magically exist when you want them to.

## Exercises  
I wasn’t just reading; I did the work too! Check out the **[Problem Solving](\machine-learning-journey\problem solving with python)** folder for all the exercises I knocked out today. It’s got everything from baby steps with functions to making files behave.

## Challenges Faced  
- Exception handling: apparently, yelling at your code doesn’t fix a `FileNotFoundError`.  
- Functions with too many parameters = debugging your soul.

## Reflections  
Functions are like your friends: reliable and reusable (if you set them up right). File handling? That’s the coworker you tolerate because they’re essential. Overall, solid progress.

## What’s Next?  
Tomorrow, I’m eyeing data manipulation—probably  maybe playing with Pandas if I’m feeling ambitious.
