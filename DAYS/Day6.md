# Day 6: Standardization, Regression, and Plotly
So, Day 6 was a rollercoaster. After taking a break on Day 5 (because life happens), I did  standardization, regression, and Plotly. Let’s just say… I got hit with a lot of info today. Here’s what went down:

## What I Learned

### 1. Standardization  
- **Scaling Data**: Got into how and why you should standardize your data before throwing it into machine learning models.  
- **Mean and Standard Deviation**: Learned that data needs to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for many models to work properly.  
- **StandardScaler**: Played around with `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn to scale my data and make it model-ready.

### 2. Regression  
- **Linear Regression**: Did  linear regression. I learned how to predict a continuous target variable based on independent features.  
- **The Math Behind It**: Tried to wrap my head around the formula (spoiler: it was a bit tricky).    
- **Evaluation**: Played with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) to check if my regression model was actually working.

### 3. Plotly  
- **Data Visualization**: Spent some time figuring out how to visualize data using Plotly.  
- **Graphs**: Created scatter plots, line graphs, and even 3D plots. Plotly is a whole world of its own, but it looks pretty slick for making interactive graphs.  
- **Overwhelming Content**: There was so much going on, it felt like drinking from a fire hose. But I powered through.

## How It Went  
- Honestly, I was a bit overwhelmed by all the content today. Standardization, regression, and learning a new tool like Plotly all at once was a lot. But , I’m getting better at pushing through the tough stuff.

## Exercises  
I’ve tried applying some of these concepts, and you can find my attempts (and possible mistakes) in the **[regression](../regression/)** folder.

## What’s Next?  
Tomorrow, I’m thinking about reviewing everything I’ve learned so far, maybe focusing on making better visualizations. Definitely need to catch my breath after today!
