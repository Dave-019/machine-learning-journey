# Days 9 & 10: Web apps for my models  

The past two days were all about Flask—the Python microframework that makes building web apps easier. it looks simple at first, but then you get to the tricky bits.

## What I Learned  

### Day 9: Getting Started with Flask Basics  
- **Flask 101**: Installed it, set up a basic app, and got my first “Hello, World!” running. Honestly, it felt like magic seeing something I coded show up in a browser.  
- **Core Concepts**:  
  - Routes: The “address book” of your app—defining which page does what.  
  
  - Debug Mode: Aka my new best friend when things inevitably broke.  

### Day 10: continuing with Flask Basics 
- **Form Handling**: Built a mini app that accepted user input (and didn’t immediately crash—success!).  
- **Integrating Machine Learning**: Hooked up one of my ML models to a Flask app, making it actually useful instead of just sitting there in a Jupyter notebook.  
- **JSON Responses**: Practiced building APIs that returned data. Flask makes it surprisingly easy.

## Highlights  
- Flask made backend development click for me—straightforward, minimal, but super powerful.  
- Watching an ML model work inside a Flask app? Pure dopamine.  

---

## Challenges  
  
- Debugging form submissions was frustrating, but I eventually cracked it.

## Code and Experiments  
All the Flask code I worked on, including the ML integration, is in the **[web-app](../web-app/)** folder. Check it out—whether to learn, borrow, or laugh at my mistakes.

## What’s Next?  
I’ll be building something cool with Flask soon. Maybe a mini project? Stay tuned.
