# Day 2: Python Basics  

Today was a solid Python learning day! Here's what I managed to cover:

## What I Learned  
1. **Python Basics**:  
   - Variables, data types, and basic input/output.  
   - Writing Python code that actually works (most of the time).  

2. **Conditionals**:  
   - If-else statements to make decisions.  
   - Nested conditionals for the slightly more complicated scenarios.  

3. **Loops**:  
   - **For Loops**: Perfect for iterating over lists, ranges, or anything iterable.  
   - **While Loops**: Great for unknown iterations (or infinite loops when you mess up).  

4. **Functions**:  
   - Writing reusable blocks of code.  
   - Function arguments, return values, and how to avoid hardcoding everything.

## Reference Book  
I followed along with [**Programming and Problem Solving with Python**](https://zlib.pub/download/programming-and-problem-solving-with-python-3s91g59ojlj0?hash=a2e86f0b6f0bf751a14e4e72e0075a1c). It’s a good guide, but life interrupted halfway through the grind.

## What’s Next?  
Tomorrow, I’ll probably look into more advanced topics like lists, dictionaries, or even dive into file handling. Let’s keep this Python train rolling!
