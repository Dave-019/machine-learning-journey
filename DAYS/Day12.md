# Day 12: Built a Spam Classifier – Because I’m Tired of Fake Emails  

Today was all about **spam detection** —those annoying “free money!” messages that nobody asked for. So, i built a model to classify if an email is spam or not...((i know the solution is already there but i want to build my own :) )

## What Went Down  

- **Trained a Spam Classifier**: Instead of me manually deleting nonsense emails, my model does the thinking. It scans email content and decides what’s legit and what belongs in the trash.  
- **Used Naive Bayes & Logistic Regression**: Turns out, spam detection is more than just looking for words like *“free money”* or *“click here”*. Had to train the model to recognize **actual patterns** in text.  
- **Data Cleaning Was a Nightmare**: Emails are messy as hell—random symbols, HTML tags, weird spacing. Spent too much time just making the data readable.

## The Good Stuff  

✅ The model **actually works**—it can separate real messages from spam with decent accuracy.  
✅ Learned more about **text classification** and why **feature selection matters**.  
✅ Turns out, spam emails have some common tricks—repeating words, weird formatting, and *way* too many exclamation marks.

## The Struggles  

- Data cleaning? **Painful**. Emails are full of random characters that confuse the model.  
- **Finding the right balance**—Too aggressive? Legit emails get marked as spam. Too relaxed? Spam sneaks through.  
- Some spam is sneaky—just because an email doesn’t say *“You’ve won a lottery”* doesn’t mean it’s not shady.
