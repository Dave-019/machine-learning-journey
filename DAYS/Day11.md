# Day 11: Back to Business - Web Apps, Gemini API, and Classifiers

Alright, so I got a little distracted by other things for a few days (life, right?), but today I was back in action. continued learning how to build web apps for my ML models, and let me tell you—today was pretty fun.

## What Went Down

### 1. Web App Magic with Streamlit and Gemini API  
- **Gemini API**: Decided to try something new and used the Gemini API to turn screenshots into a UI web app. I know, sounds like some sci-fi stuff, but Streamlit made it feel easy. Just fed it the right input, and bam—instant UI!  
- **The Web App**: Built a basic web app that takes a screenshot and uses Gemini to generate a UI. It’s nowhere near perfect yet, but it works—and that’s a win in my book. Basically, I’m on my way to making an app like MemFree AI UI Generator. Gotta love AI when it does all the heavy lifting for you.

### 2. Classifiers: The New Frontier  
- **Started Exploring Classifiers**: If you’re wondering, these are the models that help you categorize stuff, like saying whether an email is spam or not.  
- **First Impressions**: It’s like taking a bunch of data and sorting it into neat little boxes. Seems simple at first, but there’s a lot going on behind the scenes. I’m still getting the hang of it, but it’s definitely exciting.

## What Made My Day

- Streamlit is super easy to use, and I love how it makes it so easy to build web apps for my ML models.
- **Classifiers**: I have to admit, these are a bit more complicated than I thought. But the more I learn about them, the more I appreciate how they can break down complex data into understandable patterns. I’m definitely going to keep exploring these.

## What’s Coming Up

I’ll probably dive deeper into classifiers tomorrow. Maybe even start building one for a real problem. And of course, I’m going to keep tweaking that web app. Maybe I’ll make it do even more cool things. We’ll see.

## Links Coming Soon  
Once I’ve wrapped up the projects, I’ll be sharing the links so you can check out the code, get inspired, or just see where I might’ve messed up (learning is messy). Stay tuned for those!
