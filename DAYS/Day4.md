# Day 4: Vectors, Matrices, Arrays, and Data Wrangling  

Alright, today was heavy but important. I dug into some foundational stuff that’s going to come in handy one day. Let me break it down:

## What I Did  

### Vectors, Matrices, and Arrays  
- **Made some vectors and matrices**: Started from scratch, played around with sparse matrices (the ones that are mostly zeros).  
- **Basic operations**: Added, subtracted, multiplied, inverted—you name it, I tried it.  
- **Matrix stats**: Got into calculating stuff like the mean, variance, trace, rank, and even eigenvalues. Didn’t know I’d need to Google “eigenvalues” that many times, but here we are.  
- **Reshaping and transposing**: Turned rows into columns, flattened matrices, and basically twisted them into all kinds of shapes.  

### Loading Data  
- Learned how to pull data from different sources: CSVs, Excel files, JSONs, and even SQL databases.  
- Tried generating fake datasets for testing (this was surprisingly fun).  

### Data Wrangling  
- **DataFrames**: Created and navigated DataFrames like a pro—or at least tried to.  
- **Data cleaning**: Replaced bad values, dropped missing ones, and nuked duplicates.  
- **Grouping and aggregation**: Grouped data by categories, calculated sums, averages, and all that good stuff.  
- **Applied functions**: Learned how to apply custom functions over columns or groups for some serious data ninja moves.

## How It Went  
- I used the book "machine-learning-with-python-cookbook-practical-solutions-from-preprocessing-to-deep-learning_compress" i have shared in the repo ,under the books folder.
- Eigenvalues and determinants are officially my new least favorite things.  
- On the bright side, I can now look at a messy dataset and think, "I got this."

## Exercises  
I worked on a bunch of examples to cement this stuff, and I’ve shared them in the **[Problem Solving](../exercises/)** folder. Feel free to check it out if you want to see me struggle (but eventually succeed).

## What’s Next?  
Tomorrow, I’m continuing with data handling
