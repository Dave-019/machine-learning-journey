# Day 8: Logistic Regression, I Built a Model!  

Today wasn’t just about learning logistic regression—it was about making it work! used [Microsoft’s ML for Beginners - Logistic Regression](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/tree/main/2-Regression/4-Logistic),learned the theory part and ended the day with a working logistic regression model. Honestly, it felt like leveling up.

## What I Did  

### 1. learned the Basics  
- **What’s Logistic Regression?** It’s not just fancy math—it’s how you predict probabilities and classify stuff like “Spam” or “Not Spam.”  
- **The Magic Sauce (aka Sigmoid Function)**: It squeezes predictions into values between 0 and 1, turning raw numbers into probabilities.  

### 2. Built My First Logistic Regression Model  😊
- **The Task**: Build a binary classification model to predict outcomes.  
- **The Process**:  
  1. Loaded and prepped the dataset (clean data = happy model).  
  2. Trained the model using scikit-learn.  
  3. Evaluated it with accuracy, precision, recall, and even whipped up a confusion matrix.  
- **The Result**: It worked! perfect.  

### 3. Visualizing the Decision Boundary  
- Plotted the decision boundary to see how the model separates classes.  
- Turns out, a good plot is worth a thousand print statements when you’re debugging.

## Resource Used  
Big props to [Microsoft’s ML for Beginners - Logistic Regression](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/tree/main/2-Regression/4-Logistic). It explained things in a way that didn’t make me want to cry.

## My Code and Exercises  
You’ll find the logistic regression model I built (along with some practice stuff) in the **[regression](../regression/)** folder. It’s far from perfect, but it’s mine. Take a look if you’re curious (or want to roast it).

## What’s Next?  
I'll take a well-deserved break since tomorrow is Sunday and I have some other matters to attend too.
monday --> i will be learning to build web apps for my models
