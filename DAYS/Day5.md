# Day 5: Barely Did Anything, but I Cleaned a Dataset  

Let’s be real—today was not my most productive day. Life got in the way, and all I managed to do was learn how to clean a dataset. But hey, progress is progress, right?  

---

## What I Did  

### Dataset Cleaning  
- **Handling missing values**: Figured out how to fill them, drop them, or just pretend they don’t exist.  
- **Removing duplicates**: Learned how to identify and get rid of those annoying repeated rows.  
- **Replacing bad data**: Cleaned up outliers and weird entries that made no sense.  
- **Renaming and reorganizing**: Renamed columns and got things into a better format for analysis.

## How It Went  
- Honestly, it felt like the bare minimum. But now, when I look at a messy dataset, I feel slightly less overwhelmed.

## Exercises  
Nothing groundbreaking today, but I’ve updated the **[Problem Solving](../execrises/)** folder with a few small cleaning tasks I tried out.  

---

## What’s Next?  
Tomorrow, I’ll pick up the pace. Probably diving into feature engineering or data visualization—something a bit more hands-on and exciting.
