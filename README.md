# Machine Learning Learning Journey  

This repository documents my daily progress as I learn machine learning. Each day focuses on a specific topic, and I’ll push my notes, code, and reflections to the repo.

## Repository Structure  

The repository is organized by days and topics:  

Each folder will typically include:  
- **Notes**: A summary of the topic and key concepts.  
- **Code**: Examples, exercises, or small projects.  
- **Reflections**: What I learned, challenges faced, and areas for improvement.

## Goals  

1. Build a strong understanding of machine learning concepts.  
2. Gain hands-on experience by working on exercises and projects.  
3. Create a resource hub for future reference.

## Tools and Libraries  

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, Git, GitHub
